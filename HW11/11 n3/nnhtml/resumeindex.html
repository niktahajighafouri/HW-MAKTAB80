        new line How do I choose the right resume template? Choosing the right
        resume template mostly comes down to personal preference. Granted, if
        you’re applying for a job in finance, you may not want an
        abstract-leaning format like a graphic designer may use. So, as you
        browse through all the resume templates while you build your resume,
        think about what potential employers may expect to see, then pick the
        resume that fits both your personality and career goals. Free resume
        builder doesn’t usually mean free. Does Resume.com sell my information?
        Absolutely not. Our resume builder is completely free. From creating an
        account to uploading your resume to downloading and printing, you’ll
        never pay a dime. Your information is all secure and we will not sell to
        anyone.
